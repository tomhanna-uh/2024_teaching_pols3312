# Hypothesis testing

## What is a hypothesis

A falsifiable statement about what we believe will happen based on the theory we are trying to test.

## Falsifiability

- We start from the assumption that our theory is wrong

## Falsifiable

- We start from the assumption that our theory is wrong
- We assume there is no relationship



## Falsifiable

- We start from the assumption that our theory is wrong
- We assume there is no relationship
- Our hypothesis is called the 

**alternative hypothesis** or **H1**

## Falsifiable

- We start from the assumption that our theory is wrong
- Our hypothesis is called the 

**alternative hypothesis** or **H1**

- because it is the alternative to our assumption of no relationship


## Falsifiable

- We start from the assumption that our theory is wrong
- Our hypothesis is called the:

**alternative hypothesis** or **H1**

- because it is the alternative to our assumption of no relationship. This is the:


**null hypothesis** or **H0**





## Testing the null hypothesis

- Statistical tests show the degree of certainty that we can reject the null hypothesis

## Testing the null hypothesis

- Statistical tests show the degree of certainty that we can reject the null hypothesis
- They show the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is due to random chance

## Testing the null hypothesis

- Statistical tests show the degree of certainty that we can reject the null hypothesis
- They show the probability that the alternative hypothesis is due to random chance
- When the probability, *p*, is below our pre-determined threshold, we reject the null hypothesis 



## Testing the null hypothesis

- Statistical tests show the degree of certainty that we can reject the null hypothesis
- They show the probability that the alternative hypothesis is due to random chance
- When the probability, *p*, is below our pre-determined threshold, we reject the null hypothesis 
- **If we reject the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis is true, right?**


## Testing the null hypothesis

- Statistical tests show the degree of certainty that we can reject the null hypothesis
- **If we reject the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis is true, right?**


**NO!!!!**



## Rejecting the null hypothesis

If we reject the null we infer that the alternative hypothesis is approximately true within the probability we have chosen. 

## How do we get there?

**How do we get from a sample with a correlation to talking about testing a hypothesis for a population?**

## How do we get there?

**How do we get from a sample with a correlation to talking about testing a hypothesis for a population?**

- Tying *sample statistics* to *population parameters* by **Law of Large Numbers**



## Law of Large Numbers

*Given a sample of independent and identically distributed values, the sample mean converges to the true mean.*

## Law of Large Numbers

- With a large enough sample size
- the sample mean will be close to the true mean for the population



## How do we get there?

**How do we get from a sample with a correlation to talking about testing a hypothesis for a population?**

- Tying *sample statistics* to *population parameters* by **Law of Large Numbers**
- Larger sample size also reduces the *standard error* which is a special case of the standard deviation

## Standard error

- The standard error is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic
- Usually the standard error is the standard deviation of the sample mean
- Measures how accurately the sample measures the population
- Is also an element in the formula for the confidence interval and the z-score in hypothesis testing



## How do we get there?

**How do we get from a sample with a correlation to talking about testing a hypothesis for a population?**

- Tying *sample statistics* to *population parameters* by **Law of Large Numbers**
- Larger sample size also reduces the *standard error* which is a special case of the standard deviation
- Tying our data to the probability distributions


## Probability distributions

*68-95-99.7 Rule*



## Probability distributions

*68-95-99.7 Rule*

                - Allows us to estimate probability based on distance from the mean

## Probability distributions

*68-95-99.7 Rule*

                - Allows us to estimate probability based on distance from the mean
                - Applies to normal distribution
                
## Probability distributions

The *68-95-99.7 Rule*

                - Allows us to estimate probability based on distance from the mean
                - Applies to normal distribution
                - Basis for the actual decision rules using the *standard error* and the *z-score*

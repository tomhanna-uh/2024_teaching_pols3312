- 2:30 PM to 4 PM section: Monday, May 6, 2-4 PM in the regular classroom

- For those using the DART Center, you may take the exam during any available time slot on the day of your section

## Format and procedures

- The University [Academic Honesty Policy](https://www.uh.edu/provost/policies-resources/honesty/) applies including student's responsibility to report suspected violations to the instructor

        - "Students shall have the responsibility of reporting incidents of alleged academic dishonesty to the instructor of record involved, or to the appropriate authority if the alleged act is not associated with a specific class."  

## Format and procedures

- The final exam is comprehensive, covering the entire semester (Review the Midterm. Review Lecture 9. **STUDY** your missed Midterm questions. )
- The final exam will be a mix of multiple choice, short answer, and **short** essay questions. About 20% will be relatively simple statistics calculations.
- There will be some questions with sample readings from scientific articles asking you to find specific information in the article (e.g. research question, dependent variable, independent variable, results)

## Format and procedures


- What you need/can use: 
        
        - You will need pens or pencils
        - You can bring either all your notecards from class or *two* 8.5 x 11 handwritten pages of notes
        - No devices except a calculator 
        
- Everything else put away, including phones, laptops, tablets
- You do not need a blue book or scantron, paper will be provided

## Format and procedures


- No talking, no looking at other people's work, no sharing notes
- You may be asked to show your notes/notecards before, during, or after the exam 
- Arrive planning to stay until you are finished
- You may not leave the room during the exam
- No one may start the exam after the first person finishes and leaves



# Final Exam Topics

## Important Note

- This review focuses on topics and questions.
- Tip: You should try to answer the questions first, then refer to the lecture to check your answers. 
- Tip: Where the review says to "give an example," in studying it would be useful to try to think of an example of your own and make sure it matches any example given in class. 
- The answers and longer explanation are from the lectures (and *may* be found in the text).
- The review is organized in order according to the lectures.

- What kind of questions does science seek to answer?
- Is science concerned (directly) with explaining the world as it is or with making arguments about an ideal world?
- What kind of questions can science not answer (though it may contribute to the answer)?
- Why is it best to ask scientific questions in as neutral a way as possible?
- A scientific research question needs at least one thing. What is it?


## Correlation and Ordinary Least Squares Regression (Lect 8)

- What is correlation?

        - What does it measure?
        - What kind of relationship can it measure? What kind can it not measure?
        - What is the range of numbers?
        - What does -1 represent? what does 0 represent? What does 1 represent?
        - Where does correlation fit in assessing cause and effect? Does it prove specific cause and effect? Does it provide useful information about possible cause and effect?
        - Does a correlation of 0 mean there is no relationship between the variables?

## Correlation and Ordinary Least Squares Regression (Lect 8)
        
- Ordinary Least Squares regression

        - Regression is intended to find what kind of equation?
        - This is an equation that draws what geometric figure?
        - Regression is intended to find the equation that minimizes what (generally)?
        - OLS regression does this by minimizing what (specifically)?
        - What is the difference between correlation and regression?
        - Does a well fit regression equation prove cause and effect? (Hint: we had an article about this)

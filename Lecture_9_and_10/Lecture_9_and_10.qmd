## Review of Midterm

- Midterm results
- Specific issues
- Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?
- Questions?

## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?

Has anyone every discussed why this is done? Any thoughts?


## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?

- Exam serves at least three functions

        - The exam is a diagnostic tool
        - The exam is a learning tool
        - The exam is a credentialing tool 
        
## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?

- Exam serves at least three functions

- The functions require different things

        - The diagnostic and learning aspects both require a broad variation in outcomes, a wide frequency distribution of raw scores to measure differences and similarities across the class.
        - The credentialing aspect is why we adjust the scores.
        
- Why not use an actual normal distribution to adjust the scores?

        - The credentialing aspect is why we adjust the scores.

- Why not use an actual normal distribution?

        - Upper division class
        - Distribution isn't usually normal
        - A normal distribution would require some people to fail regardless of quality of work. It is possible everyone deserves the credential. It is possible though rarer that no one does. 
        
## Midterm results

- Raw scores

        - 3 raw scores of 40
        - 2 raw scores of 39.5
        - 9 raw scores of 37.5 to 38.5
        - 3 raw scores of 37
        - 17 people got all the available points or more
        - Average raw score was 29.16, a C+
        
- Adjusted scores

        - Adjusted average  30.09 (81.3%, a B-)
        - Top adjusted score was 41

- Biggest issues

        - Not attempting written answers
        - Written answers that were very shallow - "Because that's how we do it."
        - Not reading the questions carefully
        - Answers are posted. You may share them, but not with commercial websites including but not limited to Chegg or CourseHero.

## Midterm results

- Office hours
- Email after reviewing answers


## Minor procedures updates

- Class dismissal time^[https://www.uh.edu/academics/courses-enrollment/enrollment-faq/#classes%20courses]

        - 10 minutes to the hour, University policy for all classes
        - Most courses are 90 minute courses, so 80 minutes of class time
        - If you must leave early, please do not leave during the final five minutes of class
        
## Minor procedures updates

- Class dismissal time^[https://www.uh.edu/academics/courses-enrollment/enrollment-faq/#classes%20courses]

        - 10 minutes to the hour, do not leave during last five minutes of class


- Written assignments

        - If you must leave early and I have not collected them, you may leave them as you leave
        - These are mostly learning tools, so I have generally given credit for good faith participation in the exercise
        - Some require a bit more
        
- Discussion 

## Minor procedures updates

- Class dismissal time^[https://www.uh.edu/academics/courses-enrollment/enrollment-faq/#classes%20courses]

        - 10 minutes to the hour, do not leave during last five minutes of class


- Written assignments
- Discussion

        - Multiple comments from presenters about lack of discussion on articles
        - Everyone needs to be reading these ahead of the class
        - General class discussion - We are getting into less math intensive topics where more discussion is appropriate and expected

## Questions on procedural issues

Any questions?

## Written assignment for today

Which of the following is not a required element of an experiment?

- Control Group
- Manipulation (treatment)
- Random Assignment
- A laboratory setting

Hint: Think about both of the February 28th readings.

# Experiments

## Excellent resource - highly recommended to read on your own

[Experiments Chapter 7 from Empirical Methods in Political Science](https://nulib-oer.github.io/empirical-methods-polisci/experiments.html)

Reading this will be of great use to you in understanding the topic for testing, future discussion in this class, and your own knowledge

## Overview

- Why do we do experiments?
- What is an experiment?
- What are the types of experiment?
- What makes a good experiment?

## Why do we do experiments?

- In the real world, we can't observe the counterfactual or "what if" scenario. We can't observe what would have happened if we had done something different.

## Why do we do experiments?

In an experiment, we do it differently. We create the counterfactual. We create the "what if" scenario and the factual scenario and compare them. 

## Why do we do experiments?

How can we devise a way to create and compare the factual and counterfactual scenarios reliably?


## What is an experiment?

Experiments are also known as *randomized controlled trials* (RCTs) or *controlled studies*. 


## What is an experiment?

The name "randomized controlled trial" tells us a lot about what an experiment is.

## What is an experiment?

- Controlled

        - The researcher controls the manipulation (treatment or intervention)
        - The subjects (people in the trial) are divided into control group and a treatment group
        
## What is manipulation?

- The manipulation is the treatment or intervention that the researcher applies to the treatment group
- In a clinical trial this might be a new drug or a new therapy
- In one of the first political field experiments, the manipulation was a mail get-out-the-vote campaign
- The treatment group gets the manipulation, the control group does not
        
## Why do we split into two groups?

- The control group is the counterfactual scenario, the "what if" scenario
- The treatment group is the factual scenario that receives the manipulation (treatment or intervention)
- We compare the two groups to see if the manipulation had an effect
- The control group allows us to see what would have happened if we had not done the manipulation, for example if we had not sent out the get-out-the-vote campaign in the mail

        
## What is an experiment?

Randomized

- The subjects are randomly assigned to the control group or the treatment group
- Random selection, which we will discuss in non-experimental studies, is different from random assignment and not as important in experiments
        
## Why do we randomize?

- Randomization allows us to compare the groups more reliably
- Randomization in a large enough sample allows us to assume that the groups are similar in all ways except for the manipulation
- Randomization should assure that any *confounding variables* are distributed equally between the groups
        
## What is an experiment?

An experiment has three vital components:

- Manipulation (treatment or intervention)
- Random assignment
- Control group


## What are the types of experiment?

- Lab experiments
- Survey experiments
- Field experiments

## What are the types of experiment?

Lab experiments

- In a lab (controlled environment)
- High internal validity
- Low external validity

## What are the types of experiment?

Survey experiments

- In a survey
- The treatment group is shown a *vignette* before answering the survey
- Vignette may be a photo, video, or text
- Many vignettes have subjects read a mock news story about an issue
- Control vignette that omits the treatment

## Vignette example


![Vignette](simple_vignette.jpg)
## Vignette example

From the previous example, what are some things we could "leave out" of the control vignette to study a particular treatement effect?

## What are the types of experiment?

Field experiments

- In the real world
- Less concern about psychological effects of setting
- May be more generalizable

## Field experiment examples

![Field experiment](Hyattsville.png)


^[https://civic.umd.edu/news/hyattsville-and-umd-conduct-first-nation-experiment-mobilizing-voters-under-18]

## Field experiment examples

In a Get Out the Vote (GOTV) experiment, a typical design would:

- pick multiple voting precincts in the same election
- randomly assign some to receive a mailer and some not in each precinct
- select precincts to match the population of interest


## What makes a good experiment?

- Internal validity
- External validity

## What makes a good experiment?

Internal validity: Unbiased (not influenced by the researcher other than the manipulation) 

        - Design
        - Content
        - Analysis
        
Effective randomization is a major portion of internal validity

## What makes a good experiment?

External validity: Generalizability

        - To what populations can we generalize the results?
        - To what settings can we generalize the results?
        - To what times can we generalize the results?
        
Sample selection is a major portion of external validity

## What can improve external validity?

- Field experiments (natural setting)
- Large, diverse samples
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria 
- Replication (repeating with different samples)
- Psychological realism ("cover story")
- Statistical methods

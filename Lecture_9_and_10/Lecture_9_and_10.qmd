## Review of Midterm

- Midterm results
- Specific issues
- Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?
- Questions?

## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?

Has anyone every discussed why this is done? Any thoughts?


## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?

- Exam serves at least three functions

        - The exam is a diagnostic tool
        - The exam is a learning tool
        - The exam is a credentialing tool 
        
## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?

- Exam serves at least three functions

- The functions require different things

        - The diagnostic and learning aspects both require a broad variation in outcomes, a wide frequency distribution of raw scores to measure differences and similarities across the class.
        - The credentialing aspect is why we adjust the scores.
        
- Why not use an actual normal distribution to adjust the scores?

        - The credentialing aspect is why we adjust the scores.

- Why not use an actual normal distribution?

        - Upper division class
        - Distribution isn't usually normal
        - A normal distribution would require some people to fail regardless of quality of work. It is possible everyone deserves the credential. It is possible though rarer that no one does. 
        
## Midterm results

- Raw scores

        - 3 raw scores of 40
        - 2 raw scores of 39.5
        - 9 raw scores of 37.5 to 38.5
        - 3 raw scores of 37
        - 17 people got all the available points or more
        - Average raw score was 29.16, a C+
        
- Adjusted scores

        - Adjusted average  30.09 (81.3%, a B-)
        - Top adjusted score was 41

- Biggest issues

        - Not attempting written answers
        - Written answers that were very shallow - "Because that's how we do it."
        - Not reading the questions carefully
        - Answers are posted. You may share them, but not with commercial websites including but not limited to Chegg or CourseHero.

## Midterm results

- Office hours
- Email after reviewing answers


## Minor procedures updates

- Class dismissal time^[https://www.uh.edu/academics/courses-enrollment/enrollment-faq/#classes%20courses]

        - 10 minutes to the hour, University policy for all classes
        - Most courses are 90 minute courses, so 80 minutes of class time
        - If you must leave early, please do not leave during the final five minutes of class
        
## Minor procedures updates

- Class dismissal time^[https://www.uh.edu/academics/courses-enrollment/enrollment-faq/#classes%20courses]

        - 10 minutes to the hour, do not leave during last five minutes of class


- Written assignments

        - If you must leave early and I have not collected them, you may leave them as you leave
        - These are mostly learning tools, so I have generally given credit for good faith participation in the exercise
        - Some require a bit more
        
- Discussion 

## Minor procedures updates

- Class dismissal time^[https://www.uh.edu/academics/courses-enrollment/enrollment-faq/#classes%20courses]

        - 10 minutes to the hour, do not leave during last five minutes of class


- Written assignments
- Discussion

        - Multiple comments from presenters about lack of discussion on articles
        - Everyone needs to be reading these ahead of the class
        - General class discussion - We are getting into less math intensive topics where more discussion is appropriate and expected

## Questions on procedural issues

Any questions?

## Written assignment for today

What is the research question in today's reading?

- Grade range: 0.5 to 2 points
- One point for at least naming the dependent (outcome, Y) variable

## Recap of scientific method, cause and effect

- Cause and effect

        - What is a cause?
        - what is the general problem with finding true causes (includes two other problems)?

## Recap of scientific method, cause and effect

- Cause and effect

        - What is a cause?
        - what is the general problem with finding true causes?
        - What is the fundamental problem of causal inference? (Put differently: What is the hardest obstacle to determining true causes?)

        - What is a cause?
        - what is the general problem with finding true causes?

        - What is the problem in determining causes that statistical methods address?

- Scientific method

## Recap of scientific method, cause and effect

- Cause and effect: Three sets of problems

        - General problem - causes are complicated
        - Fundamental problem - we can't observe the "what if" scenario directly (the counterfactual)
        - There is a random element to the world (statistical problem)

        - Based on proof or evidence - concerns the world as it actually exists

- What is science?

        - Based on proof or evidence

        1.  Define a *research question*

**In a paper we look two places. First, we review the current literature for answers to the question. Then we move to the next step a new theory and...**

**The theory section includes what? (Step Two)**

- Scientific method

        1.  Define a *research question*
        2.  Make predictions - *hypothesis*

**Once we have predictions, we need to do two things to test them. What is step 3?**

## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?



## Why give a hard exam and adjust the score?

- Exam serves at least three functions

        - The exam is a diagnostic tool
        - The exam is a learning tool
        - The exam is a credentialing tool 
        
- The functions require different things

        - The diagnostic and learning aspects both require a broad variation in outcomes, a wide frequency distribution of raw scores to measure differences and similarities across the class.
        - The credentialing aspect is why we adjust the scores.
        
- Why not use an actual normal distribution?

        - Upper division class
        - Distribution isn't usually normal

## Problem 1 - Measures of Central Tendency

The measures of **central tendency** are the mean, median, and mode.

1. Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the following data set: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

2. Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the following data set: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21




## Problem 1 - Measures of Central Tendency (Solution)

1. Answer: 

    - Mean = sum of observations/number of observations = 11
    - Median for odd number of observations = midpoint = 11
    - Mode: None
    
2. Answer: 

    - Mean = sum of observations/number of observations = 11.5
    - Median for even number of observations = midpoint between two middle numbers = 11.5
    - Mode: None
    

    

## Problem 2 - Measures of Central Tendency

1. Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the following data set: 10, 15, 17, 15, 11, 10, 12, 15, 14, 13, 15, 16, 18

2. Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the following data set: 10, 15, 17, 13, 11, 10, 12, 13, 14, 13, 15, 16, 18, 15



## Problem 2 - Measures of Central Tendency (Solution)

1. Answer: 

    - Mean: 13.923
    - Median: 15
    - Mode: 15
    
2. Answer:

    - Mean: 13.714
    - Median: 13.5
    - Mode: 13
    


## Problem 3 - Measures of Dispersion

The measures of **dispersion** are the range, variance, and standard deviation.

- You have the following information about a data set: 

    - Mean: 10
    - Median: 10
    - Mode: 10
    - Standard Deviation: 2
    - 250 observations
    - Calculate the Variance.
    


## Problem 3 - Measures of Dispersion (Solution)

- Answer: 
 
    - Variance = square of the standard deviation = 4
    
    
## Problem 4 - Measures of Dispersion

- You have the following information about a data set:

    - Mean: 500
    - Median: 495
    - Variance: 100
    - 250 observations
    - Calculate the standard deviation.
    
## Problem 4 - Measures of Dispersion (Solution)
    
- Answer:

    - Standard Deviation = square root of the variance = 10
    

## Problem 5 - 68-95-99.7 Rule

- You have a set of data with a mean of 73.5 and a standard deviation of 1.5, and the data is normally distributed. 68% of the observations fall within what range?

- 95% of the observations fall within what range?

- 99.7% of the observations fall within what range?


## Problem 5 - 68-95-99.7 Rule (Solution)

- Answer:

    - 68% of the observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, or between 72 and 75.
    - 95% of the observations fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean, or between 70.5 and 77.5.
    - 99.7% of the observations fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean, or between 69 and 79.
    
## Problems 6 and 7 - Means of data set

```{r}

# Load the data
arrests_data <- USArrests


# display means from arrests_data set in table with titles

arrests_means <- arrests_data %>% 
  summarise_all(mean) %>%
        select(Murder,Assault,UrbanPop,Rape)

kable(arrests_means, caption = "Mean values of the USArrests data set variables")

```

<p style="background-color: crimson; color: #f1f1f1; font-size: small">From *USArrests* data set in R.</p>

        - Arrests data for the 50 US states for a single year
        - UrbanPop - state urban population percentage
        - Murder - statewide arrests for murder in a year per 100,000 population
        - Rape - statewide arrests for rape in a year per 100,000 population
        - Assault statewide arrests for assault in a year per 100,000 population


    
## Problem 6 - Linear Equations from OLS Models

```{r}

# Fit the model
arrests_model1 <- lm(Murder ~ UrbanPop, data = arrests_data)

# print to screen with stargazer
stargazer(arrests_model1, type = "text")
```
<p style="background-color: crimson; color: #f1f1f1; font-size: small">From *USArrests* data set in R.</p>


## Problem 6 - Linear Equations from OLS model

1. Using the statistical output on the previous slide, derive an equation to find the Y or dependent variable (*Murder* - statewide arrests per 100,000 population) for any value of X (*UrbanPop* - state Urban population percentage).

2. Using the equation you derived, what is the predicted murder arrest rate (*Murder*) for an urban population (*UrbanPop*) of 50%?

3. Using the equation you derived, what is the predicted murder arrest rate (*Murder*) for an urban population (*UrbanPop*) of 80%?


## Problem 6 - Linear Equations from OLS model (Solution)

$y = \alpha + \beta X$

1. $Murder = 6.416 + .021 UrbanPop$
2. Answer: $Murder = 6.416 + .021 * 50$ = 7.466
3. Answer: $Murder = 6.416 + .021 * 80$ = 8.096




## Problem 7 - Linear Equations from OLS Model with two X variables

```{r}
arrests_model2 <- lm(Murder ~ UrbanPop + Assault, data = arrests_data)

stargazer(arrests_model2, type = "text")

```

<p style="background-color: crimson; color: #f1f1f1; font-size: small">From *USArrests* data set in R.</p>


## Problem 7 - Linear Equations from OLS Model with two X variables

1. Using the statistical output from the previous slide, derive an equation to find the *Murder* arrest rate from the *Assault* arrest rate and *UrbanPop*.
2. Find the value for *Murder* arrest rate for an *Assault* arrest rate of 276 and an *UrbanPop* of 91.
3. Find the value for *Murder* arrest rate for an *Assault* arrest rate of 263 and an *UrbanPop* of 48.
4. Find the value for *Murder* arrest rate for mean values of *Assault* and *UrbanPop*



## Problem 7 - (Solutions)

$y = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2$

1. Answer: $Murder = 3.207 + .044 * Assault - .045 * UrbanPop$
2. Answer: $Murder = 3.207 + .044 * 276 - .045 * 91$ = 11.256 
3. Answer: $Murder = 3.207 + .044 * 263 - .045 * 48$ = 12.619 
4. Answer: $Murder = 3.207 + .044 * 170.76 - .045 * 65.54$ = 7.77114


## Problem 7 - Part 2

- The values for # 2 were the data set's *Assault* and *UrbanPop* numbers for California and the data set *Murder* rate is 9.0. The values for # 3 were the data set's numbers for Alaska and the data set murder rate for Alaska is 10.0. 

- Compare these to the *predicted* or *fitted* values on the previous slide. 

- Question 1 : What is the difference between these actual values and the *predicted* values called?

- Question 2 : What is the difference for California? For Alaska?


## Problem 7 - Part 2 (Solution)

- Question 1: Residuals

- Question 2: 

        - -2.256 for California
        - -2.619 for Alaska

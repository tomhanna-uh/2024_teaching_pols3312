## Agenda 

- Today

        - Review results of Monday randomization activity

        - Article "Why do citizens prefer high-skilled immigrantso low-skilled immigrants? Identifying causal mechanisms of immigration preferences with a survey experiment." Research & Politics, 9(2). https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680221091439 

        - In class activity
        

        

- For next time

        - Begin observational studies: variable types, sampling, and measurement
        - Recommended reading: https://nulib-oer.github.io/empirical-methods-polisci/data.html sections on variable types, sampling, and measurement
        - The remainder of that chapter are topics we previously covered, but may be useful for review towards the final exam


## Monday Activity

- I asked for:

        - Your month and day of birth
        - Your minor or major that is not political science
        
- I then assigned each observation based on the quarter of the year (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec)
- The birthdate provides an "as if" random assignment to the four groups

## Monday Activity Results

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

data <- read.csv(here("Data", "birthdays_majors_minors.csv"))


# convert to numeric

data <- data %>%
  mutate(Birth.quarter = as.numeric(Birth.quarter))





# # convert Birthdate variable Unknown to 99
# 
# data <- data %>%
#   mutate(Birthdate = case_when(
#     Birthdate == "Unknown" ~ 99,
#     TRUE ~ Birthdate
#   ))


# Report only the number of observations, mean, median, and mode for each variable in a table of 75% of text width

library(stargazer)
stargazer(summary(data), type="text")


```

## Monday Activity Results 


```{r echo=FALSE}
# distribution of Birth Quarters
# variable name is Birth.quarter
# use horizontal red bars

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(Birth.quarter))) +
  geom_bar(fill="red") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Distribution of Birth Quarters", x="Birth Quarter", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="top")




```

## Monday Activity Results

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Distribution of Birthdate variable name is Birthdate
# variable type is chr
# use horizontal bars for distribution

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Birthdate)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Distribution of Birthdates", x="Birthdate", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="top")





```






## Monday Activity Results

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Distribution of Major.minor overall using ggplot
# horizontal bars

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Major.minor)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Distribution of Majors/Minors", x="Major/Minor", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="top")



```


## Monday Activity Results

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Distribution of Majors/Minors by Birth Quarter
# Horizontal bars

data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Major.minor, fill=as.factor(Birth.quarter))) +
  geom_bar(position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Distribution of Majors/Minors by Birth Quarter", x="Major/Minor", y="Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position="top")






```


## Article Discussion

"Why do citizens prefer high-skilled immigrantso low-skilled immigrants? Identifying causal mechanisms of immigration preferences with a survey experiment." Research & Politics, 9(2). https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680221091439 


## In Class Activity

- In this activity, we are going to use a survey experiment vignette from an international relations study. I will give you full information on the study after the activity.
- I am doing the same activity with the other section of POLS 3312 with a different vignette (treatment) and I will show you full results after both classes have done it.
- Both classes will have a treatment and control group.
- This is not for use outside of this class. For a variety of reasons, this is a simulation, not a reliable experiment. 

## In Class Activity

- You will be randomly assigned to a group.
- The two groups will separate to opposite ends of the room, receive their survey, and complete it.
- You can then return to your regular seat and we will compile the results.

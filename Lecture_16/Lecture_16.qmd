## Ideas from Monday: Human Rights Measurement

- Starting with a definition. What is a human rights violation? This is vital for what?

## Ideas from Monday: Human Rights Measurement

- Starting with a definition. What is a human rights violation? **Validity**

- Social media posts by country. 

- Creating a rubric with specific categories of rights and deducting by category, so the standard is not total violations but categories violated

- Dividing by population size! This is really important. Why?

- Creating a rubric with specific categories of rights and deducting by category, so the standard is not total violations but categories violated

- Dividing by population size! This is really important. Why? To avoid **systemic bias** against larger countries.


## Question of the day

The fundamental problem of causal inference has been described as the inability to observe the **counterfactual** or the **what-if scenario.** 

**In your own words** explain what this means. You may want to use a simple example to illustrate your point. 

*Very important for final exam!!!*


## Surveys and Polls

- Sample size in scientific polling (today)
- Opinion polling: Margins of error, sample size, and sample selection

## Surveys and polls: Sample size

- Sample size: the number of people who are surveyed

## Surveys and polls: Sample size

- Sample size: the number of people who are surveyed


## Surveys and polls: Sample size

- Sample size: the number of people who are surveyed
- The larger the sample size, the more accurate the results but the more expensive the survey


## Surveys and polls: Sample size

- Sample size: the number of people who are surveyed
- The larger the sample size, the more accurate the results but the more expensive the survey
- The additional value of a larger sample size decreases as the sample size increases



## Surveys and polls: Sample size

- Sample size: the number of people who are surveyed
- The larger the sample size, the more accurate the results but the more expensive the survey
- The additional value of a larger sample size decreases as the sample size increases
- So, how do we set sample size?


## Surveys and polls: Sample size

One method - Statistical power

Note: This method is useful for determining minimum sample size in studies generally, *not just* survey based studies

## Surveys and polls: Sample size

One method - Statistical power


        - the probability that a study will correctly reject a false null hypothesis
        
## Surveys and polls: Sample size

One method - Statistical power


        - the probability that a study will correctly reject a false null hypothesis

        - The likelihood that a study will find a statistically significant result when there is a true effect

        - The likelihood that a study will find a statistically significant result when there is a true effect
        
        - A function of sample size, effect size, and significance level

One method - Statistical power in scientific surveys

        - The likelihood that a study will find a statistically significant result when there is a true effect
        
        - A function of sample size, effect size, and significance level
        
        - We have to have an estimate of effect size to start with
        
## Surveys and polls: Effect size        

- A large enough sample size can show statistical significance for a very tiny effect size

## Surveys and polls: Effect size        

- A large enough sample size can show statistical significance for a very tiny effect size

- For example, a study might find that a per capita income increase of $1 per day is statistically significant if the sample size is very large

- Context matters here. Why?


## Surveys and polls: Effect size        

- A large enough sample size can show statistical significance for a very tiny effect size

- For example, a study might find that a per capita income increase of $1 per day is statistically significant if the sample size is very large

- Context matters here. Why? If we are studying countries with a large population below the absolute poverty mark (\$2 per day) then a \$1 increase is important. If we are studying advanced, industrialized countries it probably is not.





## Surveys and polls: Effect size        


- A large enough sample size can show statistical significance for a very tiny effect size

- Good power calculations are based on the smallest effect that is scientifically meaningful.



## Surveys and polls: Sample size

Formula using effect size:

$$n = (\frac{Z_{1 - \alpha/2} + Z_{1 - \beta} }{ES})^2$$

where:

- $n$ = sample size
- $Z_{1 - \alpha/2}$ = Z score for the desired confidence level
- $Z_{1 - \beta}$ = Z score for desired power
- ES = **standardized** effect size

## Survey and polls: Sample size

The **standardized** effect size is:

Formula:

$$ES = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_0}{\sigma}$$

where:

- $\mu_1$ is the mean of the treatment group
- $\mu_0$ is the mean of the control group
- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the population




## Surveys and polls: Sample size

The z-scores come from the standard normal distribution and are the same we would use for hypothesis testing




## Surveys and polls: Sample size

So, for a **confidence level** of 95% and a power of 80%:

$$n = (\frac{1.96 + 0.84}{ES})^2$$

## Opinion Polls

- What are they?
- Sample selection
- Sample size


## What are Opinion Polls?

- A survey of public opinion from a particular sample of the population
- Used to gauge public opinion on a variety of topics including

        - Political candidates
        - Public policy
        - Consumer products
        - Social issues
        
## Sample Selection

- Random sampling is the best way to ensure a representative sample
- Random digit dialing
- Online surveys
- In-person interviews
- Mail surveys

## Sample Selection

Public opinion polls should use **probability sampling** 

- Random sampling
- Stratified random sampling
- Cluster sampling
- Systematic sampling

## Sample selection 

Example: Gallup uses "directory-assisted *random-digit-dial* (RDD) telephone samples using a proportionate, *stratified sampling* design" to conttact landline and cell phone users.^["How does Gallup polling work?", https://news.gallup.com/poll/101872/how-does-gallup-polling-work.aspx . Accessed April 28, 2024]

## Sample selection issues

- Sampling bias: polls of likely voters systematically exclude new voters, polls of landline phones systematically exclude GenX, Millenial, and GenZ voters
- Non-response bias: people who respond to polls may not be representative of the population


## Sample Size

![Margin of Error Formula](margin_formula.webp){width=50%}^[Qualtrics Margin of error guide & calculator, https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/research/margin-of-error/#_eswtswt4kryk]
- Where: 

        - *p* is the sample proportion
        - *n* is the sample size
        - *z* is the z-score for the desired confidence level
        
        
## Sample Size

- This works for things with an obvious sample proportion, like percent of respondents who support a candidate. 
- It is an *ex post* calculation, not a way to determine sample size before the poll is conducted.

## Sample Size

Margin of error *ex ante* calculation:^[Niles, Robert. "Survey Sample Sizes and Margin of Error". https://www.robertniles.com/stats/margin.shtml, Accessed April 28, 2024]

$margin \;  of \;  error = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$

- Where *n* is the sample size

Margin of error *ex ante* calculation:^[Niles, Robert. "Survey Sample Sizes and Margin of Error". https://www.robertniles.com/stats/margin.shtml, Accessed April 28, 2024]

$margin \;  of \;  error = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$

- Where *n* is the sample size


## Sample Size

Neither method is dependent on population size!


## Example

Gallup Daily Tracking Polls: "1,000 national adults with a margin of error of Â±4 percentage points."^["How does Gallup polling work?", https://news.gallup.com/poll/101872/how-does-gallup-polling-work.aspx . Accessed April 28, 2024]

## Categorical variables

Midterm and Final Exam Question: What are the three main measures of central tendency?
Midterm and Final Exam Question: What is the only measure of central tendency we can use with categorical variables?
Midterm and Final Exam Question: What is the hypothesis test *used in class* for categorical variables? 

## Categorical variables

Midterm and Final Exam Question: What are the three main measures of central tendency? Mean, median, mode
Midterm and Final Exam Question: What is the only measure of central tendency we can use with categorical variables? Mode
Midterm and Final Exam Question: What is the hypothesis test *used in class* for categorical variables? Chi-square test


## Categorical variables

- nominal variables

        - Example: colors = red, green, blue, orange
        - Example: species = canis lupus, equis quagga, elephas maximas
        - These are "name" variables. Nominal comes from a Latin root meaning name. Nominal in other contexts means, "in name only."
        
## Categorical variables

- nominal variables

        - Example: colors = red, green, blue, orange
        - We can assign numbers. red = 1, green = 2, blue = 3, orange = 6. 
        - Is orange divided by blue = green?

- nominal variables

        - Example: colors = red, green, blue, orange
        - We can assign numbers. red = 1, green = 2, blue = 3, orange = 6. 
        - Is orange divided by blue = green? NO!
        

        
## Categorical variables

- nominal variables
- ordinal variables

        - These are nominal variables that are in a ranked order (ORDer = ORDinal)

## Categorical variables

- nominal variables
- ordinal variables

        - These are nominal variables that are in a ranked order (ORDer = ORDinal)
        - Example: education = high school, some college, college degree, graduate degree

        - We can assign numbers. high school = 1, some college = 2, college degree = 3, Master's degree = 4, Ph.D. = 6
        - Is Ph.D divided by college degree = some college?

        - Is Ph.D divided by college degree = some college?
        - NO!

## Categorical variables

- Often considered qualititave

## Categorical variables

- Often considered qualititave because:

        - They are not ratios (two is not twice as much as one)
        - We can't add, subtract, multiply, divide them by each other or by other variables
        - They don't have means or medians
        
## Categorical variables

- Often considered qualititave because:
- They are also quantitatve because:

        - We can count them
        - We can calculate percentages
        - We can calculate modes
        - There are statistical tests and procedures specific to them (chi-square, ordered logistic regression, categorical regression)

        - Discrete
        - Continuous

        - Count variables
        - Whole numbers

        - Count variables
        - Whole numbers
        - Example: number of children in a family, number of cars in a parking lot, number of votes in an election
        - Still can be treated as ratios but have some limitations
   
## Variable types

- Continuous

        - Can take on any value in a range
        - Example: temperature, weight, height, income, age
        - The simplest dividing line is whether it can take less than a whole number value: a decimal value or a fraction
        

# Observational Studies

## Types of observational studies

- By size
- By method

## Types of observational studies

- By size

        - Case studies
        - Small-n
        - Large-n
        
## Types of observational studies

Case studies

For simplicity, I am going to refer to countries as the unit of analysis. The same techniques can apply to other units of analysis including but not limited to states, cities, counties, voting precincts, regions within a country, regions across countries, individuals, households, firms, non-profit organizations, or just about any unit of human behavior you can imagine. 
        
## Types of observational studies

Case studies

- Single country case study 
- two country comparison

## Types of observational studies

Single country case study

- Typically a detailed examination of the events leading to some outcome of interest


## Types of observational studies

Single country case study

- Typically a detailed examination of the events leading to some outcome of interest
- Often used for exploratory research
- Good for theory development

## Types of observational studies

Single country case study

- Typically a detailed examination of the events leading to some outcome of interest
- Often used for exploratory research
- Good for theory development

## Types of observational studies


Single country case study

Two concerns: generalizability (external validity) and lack of control group.  
 
- What is a way that a single country study could partially overcome these?
        
## Types of observational studies

Single country case study

Two concerns: generalizability (external validity) and lack of control group.  
 
- What is a way that a single country study could partially overcome these? 

        - Comparing the country across time
        - The country is its own control group before and after the treatment
        - The "country fixed effects" like culture and institutions are slow to change, so they are typically the same before and after
        - Other time varying effects (income, population, conflict status, etc.) can be explicitly controlled for in the analysis
        


## Types of observational studies

- By size

        - Case studies (1 or 2 countries)
        - Small-n: Three to XX 
        - Large-n: XX countries
        
Question: Based on what we discussed with regard to t-tests, z-scores, and the Central Limit Theorem, what number would you choose as the minimum dividing line between Small-n and Large-n studies? Briefly explain why. (Please write your number as digits, then explain.)

## Types of observational studies

- By size

        - Case studies (1 or 2 units of observation)
        - Small-n: Three to at least 30 units of observation
        - Medium-n: 31 to some number depending on the context
        - Large-n: at least 31 units of observation

## Types of observational studies

- By type

        - Cross-sectional
        - Time series
        - Longitudinal or Panel data 
        - Cohort studies
        
## Types of observational studies

Cross-sectional

        - Data collected at one point in time
        - This includes one-off survey data
        - Unit of analysis is simple: country, state, city, etc.
        
## Types of observational studies

Time series: Same data at different points in time

        - Data collected at multiple points in time
        - Unit of analysis would be country-year, state-year, city-year, country-month, etc.


## Types of observational studies

Longitudinal or Panel data: Same subjects at different points in time

        - Data collected at multiple points in time
        - Unit of analysis would be country-year, state-year, city-year, country-month, etc.
        - The same unit of analysis is observed at multiple points in time
        - For survey panel data, the same individuals are surveyed at multiple points in time

## Types of observational studies

Cohort studies (common in medical research)

        - A cohort is a group of people who share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period
        - The unit of analysis is the cohort
        - The cohort is followed over time
        - Example: a group of people born in 1980, a group of people who started smoking in 2000, a group of people who started a new job in 2010, etc.
  
## Reminders for Wednesday  
        
- April 3 (Wednesday)

        - Reading: Terrorism before and after 9/11 – a more dangerous world? (Smith, M., & Zeigler, S. M. (2017). Terrorism before and after 9/11 – a more dangerous world? Research & Politics, 4(4). https://doi.org/10.1177/2053168017739757)
        - Sampling and Case Selection

        - Sampling and case selection 
        - Measurement 

## Sampling and case selection

- Case selection: picking the study population(s)
- Sampling: choosing units *from* the study populations to observe


## Sampling and case selection

- This is not "either or"

        - There is often overlap with studies doing both
        - Case selection can narrow the overall pool for sampling, then good sampling further improves the quality of the study
        
- Except when it is

        - The smallest studies may make sampling impractical 
        - Large-n may mean sampling from all cases that are available and meet the criteria



## Case selection

- Case selection: picking the study population

        - narrowing the intellectual focus (areas of interest)
        - major focus in case studies and small-n
        - improving external validity and causal inference are key


## Case selection

Narrowing the intellectual focus (areas of interest)

Why?


## Case selection

- Manageability

There are limited resources, so it is more effective to focus on the cases that will yield the clearest results. 


## Case selection

How?


## Case selection


Good representation of overall population 

- This contributes to external validity/generalizability

## Case selection


Good representation of overall population 

- This contributes to external validity/generalizability
- This does not mean we have to capture every detail of the population - previous research can inform the selection



## Case selection


Good variability in independent variables 

- This is necessary in order to test hypotheses.

## Case selection


- Good variability in independent variables 

- This is necessary in order to test hypotheses.
- No variation in the Xs means we have nothing to compare in terms of the cause. 


## Case selection


- Good variability in independent variables 

- This is necessary in order to test hypotheses.
- No variation in the Xs means we have nothing to compare in terms of the cause. 
- Variation in the dependent variable (the effect) is also necessary, but can be as simple as a binary outcome (e.g. war or no war)

## Case selection


- Good variability in independent variables 

- This is necessary in order to test hypotheses.
- No variation in the Xs means we have nothing to compare in terms of the cause. 
- What about the dependent variable?

- Variation in the dependent variable (the effect) is also necessary, but can be as simple as a binary outcome (e.g. war or no war)

## Case selection


- What about variation in the dependent variable

- In small-n studies, variation in the dependent variable (the effect) is also necessary, but can be as simple as a binary outcome (e.g. war or no war)

## Case selection


- What about variation in the dependent variable

- In a two case study there are two options:

        - if the outcome (DV or Y) is the same, we would want cases where everything except the X is different. (Method of Similarity or Method of Agreement)
        
## Case selection


- What about variation in the dependent variable (Y)

- In a two case study:

        - if the outcome (Y) is the same, we would want cases where everything except the X is different. 
        
        - if the outcome (Y) is different, we would want cases where the Xs are different but all the other things we can measure are the same. (Method of Difference)

## Case selection

Finding cases that will interest readers

- If cases are not of interest, the study will not be read.
        
## Case selection

Finding cases that will interest readers

- If cases are not of interest, the study will not be read.

- More importantly, if the cases are not interesting *to people in the field*, it may indicate that the topic is really **not important.**



## Case selection

- Good representation of overall population
- Good variability in independent variables
- Finding cases that will interest readers
- Finding cases that match the interest/expertise of the researcher


## Case selection

Finding cases that match the interest/expertise of the researcher

- This is partially about managing resources, specifically the researcher's time and energy
- This is also a matter of the researcher's expertise contributing to the quality of the research
- This is also about the researcher's interest in the topic adding to the interest for the reader


## Case selection: Questions of the day

- Think of a research question of interest to you - an outcome or dependent variable you are interested in. Don't worry about causes, just think about the effect you want to explain. 
- Is there a case that you think would be interesting to study in relation to that outcome? Describe briefly how it is related and why it would appropriate. 
- **This may be the case that inspired your interest in the topic! If so, explain how.**


## case selection

Case selection: picking the study population

- major focus in case studies and small-n

"case studies are case centered" as are small-n studies^[Blatter, J. and Haverland, M. (2012). Designing case studies.. https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137016669]


## Case selection

Improving external validity and causal inference are key

        - representative population
        - variation in variables to allow for testing
        - and...
        
## Case selection

Improving external validity and causal inference are key

- adequate control variables 

Control variables are the other potential causes that we can measure

## Case selection

Improving external validity and causal inference are key

- adequate control variables 

A good sample of control variables with good measurement (low error) helps us improve both generalizability and causal inference


## Case selection

Improving external validity and causal inference are key

- adequate control variables 

Good use of control variables helps us with the fundamental problem of causal inference - it offers a similar case that can partially substitute for a true counterfactual or "what if" scenario


## Sampling and case selection

- Case selection: picking the study population

        - major focus in case studies and small-n
        - narrowing the intellectual focus for manageability and interest
        - improving external validity is important


        
- Sampling: selecting units*from* the study population to observe

        - "variable centered" focus to solve problems of validity and causal inference
        - Challenges in sampling
        - Stages of sampling
        - Types of sampling

## Sampling

Large-n studies are "variable centered"^[^[Blatter, J. and Haverland, M. (2012). Designing case studies.. https://doi.org/10.1057/9781137016669]

- Because of the size, the focus is on drawing a large *sample* that will have representative variables rather than manually selecting a small number of cases
- Often this means some sort of *random sampling* but not always



## Challenges in sampling

Population size

- Sufficient size to allow for generalization
- Sufficient sampling size to allow for generalization


## Challenges in sampling

Sampling bias

- Selection is *correlated* with the *independent variable*

## Challenges in sampling

Sampling bias

        - Selection is *correlated* with the *independent variable*
        - Systematically non-representative of the population
        
## Challenges in sampling

Selection bias

- Selection is *correlated* with the *dependent variable*
- Underestimates the relationship between the independent and dependent variables


## Challenges in sampling

Non-response bias

- The sample is not representative of the population because of who chooses to participate or the data that is available



## Stages of sampling

- Define the population

## Stages of sampling

- Define the population
- Choose the sampling frame

The portion of the population that is available for sampling


## Stages of sampling

- Define the population
- Choose the sampling frame
- Choose a sample from the sampling frame

Select the sample using some established technique



## Types Sampling

- Probability (random) sampling
- Non-probability sampling
        
## Types Sampling

- Probability (random) sampling

Advantages:

- Easy Generalizability
- Less scope for researcher bias
- Less systematic error because of unbiased selection

## Types Sampling

Probability (random) sampling

- Simple random sampling
- Stratified random sampling
- Cluster sampling
- Systematic sampling


## Types Sampling

Probability (random) sampling

- Simple random sampling - every individual (unit) has an equal chance of being selected

## Types Sampling

Probability (random) sampling

- Simple random sampling
- Stratified random sampling 

        - divide the population into groups (strata) based on shared characteristics and then randomly select from each group
        - Used to ensure inclusion of certain groups
        


## Types Sampling

Probability (random) sampling

- Simple random sampling
- Stratified random sampling 
- Cluster sampling

        - divide the population into groups (clusters) and then select clusters to sample from
        - Once clusters are selected individuals are sampled using random or stratified random sampling
        - For example, a study of US citizens might group citizens by city, then select specific cities to sample from
        - Used when the population is geographically dispersed or difficult to access
        
## Types Sampling

Probability (random) sampling

- Simple random sampling
- Stratified random sampling
- Cluster sampling
- Systematic sampling

        - Select every nth individual from the sampling frame
        - Starting point is selected randomly
        - For example, every 10th person on a list of registered voters
        - Used when the population is ordered in some way


## Types Sampling

Non-probability sampling

- Convenience sampling
- Judgmental sampling
- Snowball sampling
- Quota sampling

## Types Sampling

Non-probability sampling

- Convenience sampling (accidental sampling)

        - Selecting the most convenient individuals
        - Often used in small-n studies/exploratory research
        - Useful when resources are limited
        - May introduce significant accidental bias and reduce generalizability
        
## Types Sampling

Non-probability sampling

- Convenience sampling (accidental sampling)
- Judgmental sampling (purposive sampling)

        - Selecting individuals based on the researcher's judgment and expertise 
        - Often used in small-n studies/exploratory research
        - Useful when resources are limited
        - May introduce significant accidental bias and reduce generalizability
        - May raises questions about cherry-picking data
        
## Types Sampling

Non-probability sampling

- Convenience sampling (accidental sampling)
- Judgmental sampling (purposive sampling)
- Snowball sampling

        - Used when the population is difficult to access
        - Initial participants refer the researcher to other participants
        - Useful when the population is small or hard to reach (Example: HIV/AIDS research, drug users, homeless people)
        - Limited generalizability because it draws on a group of associated indviduals, magnifies shared characteristics
        
## Types Sampling

Non-probability sampling

- Convenience sampling (accidental sampling)
- Judgmental sampling (purposive sampling)
- Snowball sampling
- Quota sampling

        - Sorting individuals into categories using "control characteristics"
        - Selecting individuals from the categories using convenience or judgmental sampling
        - Similar to stratified random sampling but without random selection
        - Useful when the population is difficult to access, small, or hard to reach
        - Potentially introduces bias at both stages, sorting and selection

## Announcements

- Syllabus quiz will be posted soon and you will have at least one week to complete
- Reading for next Wednesday will be posted this evening or tomorrow
- Next week we will divide up the reading discussion leader/presentation assignments for later in the semester
- Slides always posted in Canvas, please don't take photos during class


## Cause and effect

- What is a cause?
- Causes are complicated!
- The Fundamental Problem
- Hypothesis Testing: Statistics and Research Design
- So what does a hypothesis test tell us?



#  What is a cause?

## What is a cause?

- Writing: what do you think? 

(You can add the "correct" answer later. Points are for your thoughts.)

## What is a cause?

- the thing that Y would not happen without

## What is a cause?

- the thing that Y would not happen without
- If X does not exist, Y will not happen

## What is a cause?

- the thing that Y would not happen without
- If X does not exist, Y will not happen

Except...



## Causes are complicated!

## Causes are complicated!

- Multiple causes

## Causes are complicated!

- Multiple causes
- Causes may be necessary but not sufficient (conditional)

## Causes are complicated!

- Multiple causes
- Causes may be necessary but not sufficient (conditional)
- Causes may be sufficient but not necessary (more than one possible sufficient cause)
 

## Causes are complicated!

- Multiple causes
- Causes may be necessary but not sufficient (conditional)
- Causes may be sufficient but not necessary (more than one possible cause)
- Some causes may be neither


## Causes are complicated!

- Multiple causes
- Causes may be necessary but not sufficient (conditional)
- Causes may be sufficient but not necessary (more than one possible cause)
- Some causes may be neither
- The randomness factor (stochastic factor)    
        
## Causes are complicated!

- Multiple causes
- Causes may be necessary but not sufficient (conditional)
- Causes may be sufficient but not necessary (more than one possible cause)
- Some causes may be neither
- The randomness factor (stochastic factor)   
- Intermediate steps (mediating or moderating variables)

- Reverse causation (endogeneity)

## Causes are complicated!

These are easy compared to the big issue...
        

# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inferance


## The Fundamental Problem

- We can't observe "what if"?
        
## The Fundamental Problem

- We can't observe the "what if"?
- Technical term: **counterfactual**
        
## The Fundamental Problem

- We can't observe the "what if"?
- Technical term: **counterfactual**
- We don't know if Y would have happened without X because X did happen


## The Fundamental Problem

- We can't observe the "what if"?
- Technical term: **counterfactual**
- We don't know if Y would have happened without X because X happened
- Huge problem for observational studies
        
        
## The Fundamental Problem

- We can't observe the "what if"?
- Technical term: **counterfactual**
- We don't know if Y would have happened without X because X happened
- Huge problem for observational studies
- Experimental design *manipulates* the data generation: partial solution

        
## The Fundamental Problem

- We can't observe the "what if"?
- Technical term: **counterfactual**
- We don't know if Y would have happened without X because X happened
- Huge problem for observational studies
- Experimental design *manipulates* the data generation: partial solution
- Observational studies rely on our treatment of the data: partial solution

## Approach 1: Statistics and hypothesis testing
        
This will be the topic for the first, smaller part of the course
        
## Approach 1: Statistics and hypothesis testing

- Statistical approach to hypothesis testing is part of the solution to the fundamental problem
- Attempts to control for the randomness factor specifically
- Our interpretation of statistical hypothesis testing is driven by the fundamental problem - confirmed approximately, not proven

## Hypothesis Testing

- Null hypothesis: effect on Y is due to random chance

## Hypothesis Testing

- Null hypothesis: effect on Y is only due to random chance
- Null hypothesis: *as if* X didn't exist


## Hypothesis Testing

- Null hypothesis: effect on Y is only due to random chance
- Null hypothesis: *as if* X didn't exist
- design the statistical model so that: null hypothesis ~ the counterfactual

## Approach 2: Research Design

- Experimental design is the gold standard
- Observational studies are the norm in many areas of political science
- Some solutions:

        - Natural experiments
        - Quasi-experiments
        - Survey experiments
        - Control variables, comparative studies
        - Mixed methods: qualitative and quantitative

## Hypothesis Testing

- Null hypothesis: effect on Y is only due to random chance
- Null hypothesis: *as if* X didn't exist
- design the model so that: null hypothesis ~ the counterfactual

That's aspirational
